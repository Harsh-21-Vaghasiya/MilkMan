# MilkMan

This application is made to help people By providing Milk Selevery Service.
In the village, most people collect milk at the dairy. But in the city, most people want home delivery of milk, and this system is running in the city. But the problem is that to keep a record of the past delivery data, if anyone wants to make changes in the daily milk quantity, it will cause more confusion for the milkman.

To Solve this problem, the Milkman app was created.

Features

1. Keep a record of the past data.

2. Address functionality to find the customer's home

3. Any time changes the quantity of milk for the next day.

4. Make the bill automatic.

This app is used by both the customer and milkman sides, so both can check past data and easily communicate.
Also, this app is available in Gujarati, Hindi,Â  and English so users can use it in their native language.



Technical:

This app is made with Android and the PHP server.

On the PHP server, all the data of the app is managed.
